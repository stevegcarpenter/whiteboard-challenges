# Whiteboard Challenge 36

#### Write a function which takes two binary search trees as arguments, and compares them for structural likeness.
- If they are structurally identical, return true
- Else return false

#### Write at least four tests for this function
- your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
- your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
