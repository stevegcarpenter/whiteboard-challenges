# Whiteboard Challenge 31

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection

example: Given `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]`, `nums2 = [2, 2]`, return `[2]`.

Write at least four tests for this function

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
