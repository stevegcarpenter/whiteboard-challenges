# Whiteboard Challenge 33

Write a function while takes two arguments, a base number and an exponential, and returns the sum of the return value's digits.

For example: `fn(2, 15) => 32768 => 26`

Write at least four tests for this function

your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
